# MetPy-Map-Maker
This is an interactive code that can be used to create standard weather maps by utilizing code from 
MetPy, CartoPy, datetime, and pandas. 
This was created using help from Kevin Goebber's WxTech EBook for my MET-130 class at Valparaiso University 
and utilizing if statements to combine the map codes into an easy-to-use terminal code, instead of
going back and changing every date, time, and level of the atmosphere.
